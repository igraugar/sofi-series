"""Perturbation curves and the objective optimized by SOFI.

A ranking is assessed through two perturbation curves obtained after cumulative
marginalization of time series segments. The MoRF curve removes the most
relevant segments first and should collapse immediately, while the LeRF curve
removes the least relevant segments first and should stay flat for as long as
possible. The degradation score is the integral between the two, and SOFI
maximizes it. The MoRF branch rewards sparsity, since a sparse explanation
concentrates the response of the model in a handful of segments, and the LeRF
branch rewards correctness, since the segments declared irrelevant must be the
ones whose removal leaves the response untouched.

Both curves report the probability the model assigns to the class it predicted
before any perturbation, as in region perturbation, and nothing else. No ground
truth label takes part, which keeps explanations free from the bias induced by
the error of the model, and no rescaling is applied, so a value of 0.4 is a
probability of 0.4 and can be read against the confidence of the model rather
than against an anchor chosen for drawing.
