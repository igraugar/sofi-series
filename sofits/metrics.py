"""Quality measures applied to segment rankings.

Three properties are reported. Faithfulness and sparsity come from the
degradation score and from the sparsity rate, both computed by the objective.
Robustness is measured here, through the agreement between the ranking of an
instance and the ranking of its nearest neighbor.

Robustness rests on the assumption that locally similar series deserve similar
explanations. That assumption is common in the literature, yet it is not
correlated with the other two properties, and a method can be perfectly stable
while being unfaithful. Multimodal explanation spaces, where several distinct
rankings are equally valid, also escape the measure. The number is therefore
informative alongside the others and misleading on its own.

    """Similarity of two rankings, weighted toward the leading positions.

    Rank biased overlap compares the two lists prefix by prefix and discounts
    each depth geometrically, so agreement among the most relevant segments
    counts far more than agreement in the tail. A value of one denotes identical
    rankings and a value of zero denotes disjoint ones.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first, second : sequence
        The two rankings, from the most to the least relevant.
    p : float, default=0.8
        Persistence of the geometric weights. The expected evaluation depth is
        ``1 / (1 - p)``, so the default looks about five positions deep, which
        is the setting used in the paper.
    extrapolate : bool, default=True

        correction that makes the measure meaningful for finite lists.
