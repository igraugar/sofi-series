"""One prediction contract for every time series classifier.

SOFI queries a black box thousands of times and needs nothing from it beyond
class probabilities. The wrapper below reduces any supported estimator to a
single function that receives an array shaped ``(n_instances, n_channels,
n_timestamps)`` and returns an array shaped ``(n_instances, n_classes)`` whose
rows sum to one.

Five families are recognized without importing their libraries at module load,
so neither PyTorch nor TensorFlow becomes a dependency of the package.

1. A ``tsai`` learner, queried through ``get_X_preds``.
2. A scikit-learn style estimator exposing ``predict_proba``, including the
   wrappers of ``aeon`` and ``sktime``.
3. A Keras or TensorFlow model, evaluated through its call interface.
4. A ``torch.nn.Module``, evaluated under ``no_grad`` on the device of its own
   parameters.

A fitted model is always required, since the explanation describes that model
and nothing else. What ``output_fn`` adds is a way of naming the method of the
model that produces the outputs, for the cases where the detection would pick
the wrong one or where no method is exposed under a familiar name.

Two conventions are resolved once, on a probe batch drawn from the training
data, and then held fixed. The output convention states whether the model emits
probabilities or logits, and the channel layout states whether it expects the
channel axis before or after the time axis. Both are detected by default and
both can be stated explicitly when the probe is ambiguous.

A model that exposes hard labels alone is rejected at construction time.
Probability degradation is the quantity SOFI measures, so a label is not enough,
and failing early with a readable message is preferable to failing inside the
search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : object
        Fitted classifier. PyTorch modules, Keras models, ``tsai`` learners and
        scikit-learn style estimators are recognized without further
        declaration.
    output_fn : str or callable, optional
        Method of the model that produces the outputs. A string names an
        attribute of the model, such as ``"predict_proba"`` or ``"forward"``,
        and a callable receives the batch and returns the outputs directly. The
        detection resolves it when the argument is left out, which covers the
        four supported families.
    output : {"auto", "proba", "logits"}, default="auto"
        Whether the raw output already holds probabilities. Under ``auto`` the
        probe decides, and a softmax is applied only when the raw output fails
        the simplex test. Stating the convention removes any doubt.
    channels_first : {"auto", True, False}, default="auto"
        Whether the model expects the channel axis before the time axis, which
        is the PyTorch convention, or after it, which is the Keras convention.
        Under ``auto`` the probe tries both orientations.
    classes : sequence, optional
        Class labels in the order of the probability columns, used for
        reporting alone. They are read from the estimator when available.
    device : str, optional
        Device on which a PyTorch module is evaluated. The device of the
        parameters of the module is used by default.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether the resolved conventions are announced once at construction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_classes : int
        Number of probability columns, read from the probe.
    backend : str
        Name of the family that was detected.
