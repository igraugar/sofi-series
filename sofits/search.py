"""Search over the space of segment rankings.

Two procedures are available and they answer different questions.

The sequential ranking of Algorithm 3 selects, at every position, the segment whose
perturbation lowers the probability of the explained class the most, given
everything already perturbed. Theorem 3 proves that this ranking is optimal when
the black box is modular, and it costs a quadratic number of queries in the
number of segments. It also serves as a strong starting point for the search.

Hill climbing improves an incumbent ranking through a local operator that swaps
two randomly selected positions. A candidate is accepted when it raises the
degradation score, and the run ends after a budget of proposals or once the
patience expires. Modularity rarely holds in practice, since the effect of
perturbing one segment depends on what was perturbed before, so the search
usually finds rankings the greedy procedure cannot reach.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_segments : int
        Length of a ranking.
    evaluate : callable
        Receives a ranking and, optionally, the evaluation of the incumbent
        together with the swapped positions. It returns an object exposing
        ``order`` and ``ds``.
    initial_order : sequence of int
        Ranking the first climb starts from.
    max_iterations : int, default=100
        Upper bound on the proposed swaps across every restart.
    patience : int, optional
        Consecutive proposals without improvement tolerated before a restart or
        the end of the run. ``None`` spends the whole budget.
    n_restarts : int, default=0
        Restarts from a random ranking granted once the patience expires.
    accept_equal : bool, default=False
        Whether swaps that leave the score unchanged are accepted, which lets
        the search drift along plateaus.
    rng : Generator, optional
        Source of randomness of the operator and of the restarts.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Whether a progress bar is displayed.
    description : str, default="SOFI search"
        Label placed on the progress bar.
    record_history : bool, default=True
        Whether one record per proposal is kept, which the explanation carries
        as its history.

    -------
    dict
        The best evaluation found, the history and a few counters.
